# RICK AND MORTY APP

Simple Application to show and filter Rick and Morty Images.

## Installation

Aftet cloning the Application, run the command:

```bash
npm install
```

and then, run the command:

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

A new browser will be automatically opened on http://localhost:3000.

Here, when the Component mounts, a list of images on the first page is shown.

There is a Search Bar to filter the Characters on that page, depending on the matching letters/name.
Upon searching, a new Area is shown with red border.

When an image is clicked, a new component is mounted, showing the details of the selected Character on a Card Component.

Below the Grid of Images, the Pagination allows the user to navigate between different pages, that will load and show different Characters.

Finally, below the main Area, three small charts will show the number of Characters that belong to Male, Female and Unknown, for that particular page.
